<h1>1 in 3 Customers Disappointed by Click & Collect Experience</h1><p>Customer demand for click and collect services has been rapidly increasing in the last few years, with 41% of shoppers using it over the Christmas period vs 39% in 2014. And yet, as a recent report from <a href="www.centrino.com">JDA and Centrino</a> demonstrates, many retailers are failing to meet their customer’s expectations.</p><p>31% of those surveyed who used click and collect over Christmas 2015 found that retailers didn’t have a dedicated area in store to collect orders, and experienced long waiting times. 24% said staff took a long time to find orders, or couldn’t locate them at all when they arrived.</p><p>Multichannel isn’t easy. A truly integrated multichannel strategy demands the right hardware and software, often requiring a POS upgrade, staff training and a real understanding of the logistical processes. Many retailers, in the rush to provide at least the same facilities as their competitors, launched click and collect without covering all the bases, and haven’t had the chance to improve it yet.  But since such a high proportion of online customers are now choosing to collect in store, it’s time to make sure we’re meeting their expectations.</p><p>So what can you do to ensure that your click and collect customers, who, after all, are often your most valuable customers aren’t disappointed by the experience?</p><h3> 1. Don’t treat them like second class citizens</h3><p>My experience in a high end London department store that shall remain nameless was a depressing example of how customers who shop online and collect in store are sometimes treated as though they are less important. The store did have a dedicated click and collect point, but it was accessible either through the goods entrance behind the store or via the shabby staff-only corridors. The room itself contained a desk, a TV and a single plastic chair. My order was wrapped messily in cellophane, and I wasn’t offered one of the store’s iconic carrier bags. I felt as though I’d somehow offended them by ordering online. I haven’t been back.</p><h3>2. Don’t make them wait</h3><p>At the other end of the scale, department stores such as Debenhams and De Bijenkorf have dedicated, well manned and well sign-posted collection points with helpful staff, but queues can still be frustratingly long. This will always be a problem during peak trade, but you could consider allowing customers to check in to the store via your app when they enter, and then notify them when their order is ready to collect.</p><h3>3. Review your processes</h3><p>So you’ve been doing this click and collect thing for some time now? Great. Now find out how it’s actually working. Place a few orders yourself, survey your customers and talk to the store staff. There will inevitably be some refinements you can make that will greatly improve the process. At one retailer where I implemented the process, it was only after talking to store staff that we realised the rail where the orders were stored in the stock room was being raided by staff looking for sizes unavailable on the shop floor. This meant some customers were coming to the store only to find their order had disappeared.</p><h3>4. Staff training is critical</h3><p>If you don’t have a dedicated area for your customers to pick up their click and collect orders then it’s absolutely critical that all your staff are trained to deal with click and collect customers. They will probably need to learn a new process to deal with the transaction at POS, and the person who works for four hours on a Saturday needs to understand this as well as the store manager. It should be irrelevant which channel your customer chose to make an order, the process should be as seamless as selecting a dress, taking it to the counter and paying.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">1 in 3 Customers Disappointed by Click &amp; Collect Experience</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The room itself contained a desk, a TV and a single plastic chair. My order was wrapped messily in cellophane, and I wasn’t offered one of the store’s iconic carrier bags.
