# Is it Time to Make Your Wallet Mobile? 

Contactless mobile payment is a powerful combination of an experience that makes consumers' lives easier, and one that helps retailers to sell more. And take up of the technology is increasing dramatically in the UK.

The technology is certainly not new (Android phones have been using the NFC standard for mobile payments for some time), but Apple's entry into the market with Apple Pay has raised its profile and encouraged consumers outside of the geek and early adopter market to take advantage of the convenience it offers.

With high street giants like Boots and M&S on board, and many more set to launch in the run up to peak trade, it's likely that more and more consumers will start to make the move towards switching from wallet to mobile.

**Apple Pay**

Apple Pay launched in the US over a year ago, and in July in the UK, enabling iPhone 6 and Apple Watch owners to pay in participating stores and apps.

As we've come to expect from Apple launches, take up has been rapid, with 1 million activations in the UK in the first 3 days (according to Apple).

According to [globalwebindex.net][0] 4 in 10 iPhone 6 or Apple Watch owners have used Apple Pay already, and a further 3 in 10 expressed interest in using it in the future, showing Apple could convert almost 3/4 of the potential audience to use this feature.

But it's certainly not all about Apple. There are more developments in the contactless payment market:

**Starbucks App**

The Starbucks app is a branded mobile app payment solution that has 13 million mobile users in the US and processes 7 million mobile transactions each week, accounting for 20% of Starbucks sales. As well as offering loyalty rewards and convenience for their customers, it also allows Starbucks to track purchases and gather valuable data on spending habits.

Until recently customers were able to use Apple Pay to top up their credit within the app, but not as a payment method in stores. However, as Starbucks start to  roll out Apple Pay in their stores, presumably it will be in their interests to encourage customers to continue to buy their pumpkin spice lattes with the branded app to retail the all important customer data.

**Wearables**

Wearable technologies are being developed to tap into the growing contactless payment market.

MasterCard is working with startups to develop a variety of connected payment devices that a consumer would already be carrying, for example a key fob, fitness tracker wristband or ring.

These simple devices may be the way of the future for wallet-busting. The [Kerv Smart Ring][1] for example, doesn't need charging, and doesn't even need to be paired with a smartphone -- perfect for runners who want a coffee or a bus fare on their way home after a workout.

**Don't dispose of your wallet just yet**

Consumers are becoming more familiar with the process, and more banks and merchants are beginning to accept this type of transaction. However there are still some issues that need to be resolved before we will all ditch our wallets in favour of our mobiles:

1. **Staff training**There may be issues ensuring that store staff to understand the technologies, particularly how to handle returns. It's important to have robust training plans in place to make sure customers aren't frustrated by what should be a more convenient experience.
2. **PSP Limitations**Most contactless transactions are currently limited to a maximum of £30, however this limit is imposed by the Payment Service Provider (PSP) and some stores can accept High Value Contactless payments.
3. **Geography**There are no global standards, and roll out and adoption differs across the world. Some mobile wallets do operate in more than one country, but none are accepted worldwide. Apple Pay rolled out in the US over a year ago, and was introduced in the UK in July this year, but it is yet to be launched in Europe. Most European countries are expected to accept some form of contactless payment by 2020\.
4. **Availability**Some banks and merchants have been slow to pick it up. If you're an iPhone 6 owning Barclays customer you won't be able to use Apple Pay until early next year.
5. **Security**A study carried out by YouGov in June 2015 found that out of the 47% of respondents who didn't want to use their phone to make a payment, the majority had concerns about security. It's likely that confidence in the system will increase as more and more trusted brands begin to offer it.
